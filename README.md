# Some_code_for_share
Private repo with prev. to see it ;)
Only people with the link can check the repo,
Some codes are not working
because I do not want to provide special
personal data to fulfill my needs.
Please be informed that to run the code
on a local PC, you need to install some libraries.
This is only some example code to show as an example.
Please be aware that this is just a demo to show 
the logic ability and problem-solving skills.

Kind regards,
Danielski.
